# CV-classifier-Predicts-Cat-or-Dog-Model-
This is an Computer Vision model made using Tensorflow and Keras which is trained with over 8000 images of cats and dogs to predict weather the image shown to it is a Cat or Dog. 
This model is made using freely available data of test and training sets on Kaggle.com and the model will work only if it is used in the Kaggle IDE (https://www.kaggle.com/tongpython/cat-and-dog). 
My kaggle code (https://www.kaggle.com/freakything/cv-cat-or-dog-classifier-model/edit).
